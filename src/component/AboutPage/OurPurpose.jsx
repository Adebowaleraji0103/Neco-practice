            The story of NECO and its achievements is a continuously developing
            one and cannot be completely told in a piece as short as this.
            However, as has been observed elsewhere, Perhaps, the greatest
            achievement of NECO is that it has provided gainful employment for
            over a thousand Nigerians [and given hope to thousands more â€“
            candidates who had been able to keep their matriculation dates
            because of the timely release of their results by NECO].
