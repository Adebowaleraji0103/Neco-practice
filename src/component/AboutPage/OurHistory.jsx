          The establishment of the National Examinations Council (NECO) in April
          1999, is a culmination of reaction of the Federal Government to
          widespread escalating agitations for a national examination outfit

          recommended among other things, the establishment of additional
          examination bodies to reduce the workload of WAEC and make it more
